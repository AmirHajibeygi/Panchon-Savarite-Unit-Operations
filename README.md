# Panchon-Savarite-Unit-Operations
The Ponchon-Savarit method is a graphical distillation design approach using H-x diagrams to combine mass and energy balances. It provides a more detailed analysis than McCabe-Thiele by including enthalpy effects but is limited to binary systems, assumes equilibrium stages, and often neglects non-idealities and multicomponent separations

In this project you can draw panchon savarite method and then count numbers of stages for your own system.I have done a sample.
